# Aegis Insurance Platform

Aegis is a Next.js application that demonstrates a commission-protection workflow for insurance agencies and agents. It models how commissions are split into **safe** and **vaulted** balances, how vaults **vest over time**, and how **chargebacks/advances** create debt that can be repaid via garnishment.

This repository is currently a front-end demo powered by local mock JSON data.

## What This Project Does

The app provides two dashboard experiences:

1. **Agency view** for owners/managers to monitor aggregate risk and configure operations.
2. **Agent view** for individual producers to track available funds, vaulting, vesting, and debt.

It is designed as an interactive product demo with a realistic information architecture and business flow.

## Core Concepts

- **Safe balance**: funds immediately available to spend.
- **Vaulted balance**: withheld funds that protect against future chargebacks.
- **Vesting**: gradual release of vaulted funds over time.
- **Debt**: obligations caused by chargebacks or advances.
- **Garnishment**: automatic repayment of debt from future commissions.

## Key Features

### Landing Experience

- Marketing-style homepage at `/` with feature highlights and navigation to demos.

### Agency Dashboard

- Portfolio-level metrics for vaulted, safe, and debt balances.
- Agent-level table and detail views.
- Commission trend and performance visualizations.
- Real-time simulation/risk components.
- Dedicated pages for:
  - debt management
  - vault rule configuration
  - vesting management

### Agent Dashboard

- Personal financial overview cards (safe, vaulted, debt).
- Debt alerts and debt history view.
- Commission and vault breakdown charts.
- Book-of-business display.
- Interactive vault visualizer.
- Recent commissions and vesting-linked vault list.

## Tech Stack

## Data Model and Mock Data

The UI is driven by local JSON data under `src/data/`.

Primary datasets:

- `agents.json`: profile/status and balance/risk metadata per agent
- `commissions.json`: gross/safe/vaulted values, policy metadata, status, dates
- `debts.json`: active and historical debt records (chargebacks, advances)
- `vault-rules.json`: split percentages and vesting configuration
- `vesting-schedule.json`: pending/completed vesting events

There is also a shared TypeScript model layer in `src/lib/types.ts` that represents the intended domain entities.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)
- npm 9+

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Start production server (after build)
npm run lint     # Lint the codebase
```

## Deployment

A public deployment is available at:

- https://aegis-insurance.pages.dev/

If deploying this repository yourself, standard Next.js deployment targets (Vercel, Cloudflare-compatible setups, etc.) apply.

Example (Vercel):

1. Import the GitHub repository into Vercel.
2. Keep default framework detection as **Next.js**.
3. Use install/build commands:
   - Install: `npm install`
   - Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy (no required environment variables for the current mock-data demo).

## Known Baseline Issues

Current repository baseline includes pre-existing lint and build issues unrelated to this README update:

- `npm run lint` reports existing TypeScript/ESLint violations in multiple app/component files.
- `npm run build` may fail in restricted/offline environments because `next/font` attempts to fetch Inter from Google Fonts (`fonts.googleapis.com`).
  - Recommended approach for most restricted environments: switch to a
    local/self-hosted font in `src/app/layout.tsx` by removing the
    `next/font/google` `Inter` import/initializer and replacing it with a local
    font strategy, which removes external font fetches at build time.
    A common approach is using `next/font/local` with font files stored under
    `public/fonts`.
  - Alternative workarounds include allowing outbound access to `fonts.googleapis.com`.

These are existing project conditions and not introduced by this documentation change.
